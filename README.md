Lab 3A
Understanding the basic components of a Block in Blockchain and implementing it's functionality in a python program. Also solving a cryptographic hash puzzle such that we get 4 prefixed zeros as start of the block hash is implemented. 

Lab 3B
With the created Block, we can now create a Blockchain with basic functionality such as displaying it's data, next hash, previous hash, timestamp and nonce used to create the hash.
